	abstract = {The generation of novelty is central to any creative endeavor. Novelty generation and the relationship between novelty and individual hedonic value have long been subjects of study in social psychology. However, few studies have utilized large-scale datasets to quantitatively investigate these issues. Here we consider the domain of American cinema and explore these questions using a database of films spanning a 70 year period. We use crowdsourced keywords from the Internet Movie Database as a window into the contents of films and prescribe novelty scores for each film based on occurrence probabilities of individual keywords and keyword-pairs. These scores provide revealing insights into the dynamics of novelty in cinema. We investigate how novelty influences the revenue generated by a film and find a relationship that resembles the Wundt-Berlyne curve. We also study the statistics of keyword occurrence and the aggregate distribution of keywords over a 100 year period.},

For the sound-era movies of both sets there is little evidence indicating anything other than a linear decline plotted on a logarithmic scale, with the English-language set providing stronger results. In a subsample of 24 English-language movies from 1940 to 2010 the decline in shot duration is uniform across 15 shot classes, a result that supports a broad “evolutionary” account of film change. The article also explores the proportions of these shot classes across years and genres, with the results showing that 25 percent of the decline in shot duration is due to a shift away from shot classes with longer-than-average shot durations towards those with shorter-than-average durations, and 8 percent of the decline is due to the increased use of shot scales in which characters appear larger.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {, We present a comprehensive analysis of the rise of fictions across human narratives, using large-scale datasets that collectively span over 65,000 works across various media (movies, literary works), cultures (over 30 countries, Western and non-Western), and time periods (2000 BCE to 2020 CE). We measured fictiveness – defined as the degree of departure from reality – across three narrative dimensions: protagonists, events, and settings. We used automatic annotations from large language models (LLMs) to systematically score fictiveness and ensured the robustness and validity of our measure, specifically by demonstrating predictable variations in fictiveness across different genres, in all media. Statistical analyses of the changes in fictiveness over time revealed a steady increase, culminating in the 20th and 21st centuries, across all narrative forms. Remarkably, this trend is also evident in our data spanning ancient times: fictiveness increased gradually in narratives dating back as far as 2000 BCE, with notable peaks of fictiveness during affluent periods such as the heights of the Roman Empire, the Tang Dynasty, and the European Renaissance. We explore potential psychological explanations for the rise in fictiveness, including changing audience preferences driven by ecological and social changes.},

The editing style of the situation comedy Happy Days (1974–1984) provides an intriguing test case for the utility of such analyses, as the show made a radical shift in its mode of production after its second season—switching from single camera to multiple camera (with a studio audience). Using data collected on Shot Logger (http://www.shotlogger.org), this article measures the cutting rates correlated with each mode of production and finds a statistically significant difference between the two. Additionally, the article examines the general acceleration of cutting rates on American television since 1951 and comes to a perhaps surprising conclusion about the impact of individual editors on television style.},

	abstract = {Polarization of opinion is an important feature of public debate on political, social and cultural topics. The availability of large internet databases of users’ ratings has permitted quantitative analysis of polarization trends—for instance, previous studies have included analyses of controversial topics on Wikipedia, as well as the relationship between online reviews and a product’s perceived quality. Here, we study the dynamics of polarization in the movie ratings collected by the Internet Movie database (IMDb) website in relation to films produced over the period 1915–2015. We define two statistical indexes, dubbed hard and soft controversiality, which quantify polarized and uniform rating distributions, respectively. We find that controversy decreases with popularity and that hard controversy is relatively rare. Our findings also suggest that more recent movies are more controversial than older ones and we detect a trend of “convergence to the mainstream” with a time scale of roughly 40–50 years. This phenomenon appears qualitatively different from trends observed in both online reviews of commercial products and in political debate, and we speculate that it may be connected with the absence of long-lived “echo chambers” in the cultural domain. This hypothesis can and should be tested by extending our analysis to other forms of cultural expression and/or to databases with different demographic user bases.},

	abstract = {The profound impact of Darwin's theory of evolution on biology has led to the acceptance of the theory in many complex systems that lie well beyond its original domain. Culture is one example that also exhibits key Darwinian evolutionary properties: Differential adoption of cultural variants (variation and selection), new entities imitating older ones (inheritance), and convergence toward the most suitable state (adaptation). In this work we present a framework for capturing the details of the evolutionary dynamics in cultural systems on the "meme"- the cultural analog of the biological gene-level, and analyze large-scale, comprehensive movie-meme association data to construct a timeline of the history of cinema via the evolution of genres and the rise and fall of prominent sub-genres. We also identify the impactful movies that were harbingers to popular memes that we may say correspond to the proverbial "Eve" of the human race, shining light on the process by which certain genres form and grow. Finally, we measure how the impact of movies correlates with the experts' and the public's assessment.},

Second, contemporary ﬁlms have more motion and movement than earlier ﬁlms. Third, in contemporary ﬁlms shorter shots also have proportionately more motion than longer shots, whereas there is no such relation in older ﬁlms. And ﬁnally ﬁlms have gotten darker. That is, the mean luminance value of frames across the length of a ﬁlm has decreased over time. We discuss psychological effects associated with these four changes and suggest that all four linear trends have a single cause: Filmmakers have incrementally tried to exercise more control over the attention of ﬁlmgoers. We suggest these changes are signatures of the evolution of popular ﬁlm; they do not reﬂect changes in ﬁlm style.},

Deviations from the chronological order in a narrative are called anachronies. Narratological theory and the evidence from psychological experiments indicate that anachronies allow stories to be more interesting, as the non-chronological order evokes curiosity in viewers. In this paper we investigate the historical dynamics in the use of anachronies in film. Particularly, we follow the cultural attraction theory that suggests that, given certain conditions, cultural evolution should conform to our cognitive preferences. We study this on a corpus of 80 most popular mystery films released in 1970–2009. We observe that anachronies have become used more frequently, and in a greater proportion of films. We also find that films that made substantial use of anachronies, on average, distributed the anachronies evenly along film length, while the films that made little use of anachronies placed them near the beginning and end. We argue that this can reflect a functional difference between these two types of using anachronies. The paper adds further support to the argument that popular culture may be influenced to a significant degree by our cognitive biases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
